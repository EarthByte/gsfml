------------------------------------------------------

The gsfml supplement to GMT allows for the analysis of fracture zone (FZ)
traces by constructing cross-profiles of gridded data along the digitized
FZ and doing an extensive analysis per profile to determine the exact FZ
location.  This step is done by fzanalyzer.  Given the output of fzanalyzer
you can construct optimal FZ traces by blending between the digitized and
modeled traces using fzblender.  You can use the scripts fzinformer,
fzmapper, fzmodeler and fzprofiler to make plots of these traces with
along-track statistical summary plots, map views, build synthetic profiles,
or plot cross-section profiles, respectively.
In addition, mlconverter can convert OGR/GMT data files with magnetic picks
and replace chron strings with ages given specified magnetic time scale.

To build the gsfml supplement requires the GMT 6 or newer version.
Follow these instructions.  The cmake directory comes with a basic
ConfigUser.cmake file and while you should not have to make any edits,
you can poke around if things fails:

1. Run "make all".  This will run the cmake configuration and build
   the GSFML plugin library and bash scripts.
2. To access the scripts and the plugin from gmt, run "make install"
   (You may have to run via sudo if install into system directories).
   This will install the scripts and the plugin into the GMT bin
   and plugin directories, respectively.
3. Try it out to see if your modules can be accessed, e.g.,

	gmt fzanalyzer
	gmt fzblender
	fzmapper

This directory contains several files.  Note that the man pages have not
been reformatted to rst as the rest of GMT.  You can find Unix man pages
and PDF versions in the share directory.
