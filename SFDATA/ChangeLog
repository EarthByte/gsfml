2015-03-24	pwessel
	Incorporate Kara's latest revisions.  Using the 23.1 VGG grid she
	added 85 new features, revised 156 existing ones, and deleted on
	(FZ_KM_0001-0566).  The revised files were used to update the older
	traces (retaining their file names), the new files were added but
	renamed to start a new submission for KM (3) with IDs starting at 1,
	and the FZ_KM_0001-0566 was moved to the OBSOLETE folder.
	
2014-01-21	pwessel
	Name change.  Dir FZDATA (and FZ) are now SFDATA (and SF)
	since FZ is just one of the seafloor fabric trends digitized.

2014-01-06	pwessel
	Added 9 FZ tracks from the Ellice Basin by Mike Chandler

2011-07-18	pwessel
	Added new category ER = Extinct Ridges and added Kara's 24 extinct

	Several FZs were modified due to the ERs.
	We also deleted FZ_KM_0001-0178.txt
