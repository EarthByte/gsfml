#	Information file for Hellinger data formats
#
#	Paul Wessel, Nov. 2013, Revised July 2015

This directory contains the input data used for several published plate models.
This modeling is done with software such as Ted Chang's hellinger[1|3] programs
and the file formats reflect its expected input and output layout.
To ensure a uniform system of nomenclature we have renamed all submitted files
to follow a specific naming convention.  Each directory will have a top-level
readme file called readme.<ref>.txt, which gives minimal information about the
files in the directory, including full reference and DOI of the published paper.
In addition there will sometimes be files that describe the data sets further.
If present, these are called

description.<ref>.<txt|docx>

and will either be in text format or the Microsoft docx (xml-based) format.

All additional files in this directory are called

	<plates>.<chron>.<version>.<kind>.<ref>.<ext>

where the various name-segments are:

<plates>:	Hyphen-separated list of plates involved, starting with fixed plate
		(typically 2 plates only, but sometimes 3 or even 4).
<chron>:	The Chron being modeled (sometimes a tag if no specific chron was used)
<version>:	Author-provided version if more than one solution, otherwise set to final.
<kind>:		One of data, model, command, residual, lowerbound, upperbound, confregion.
		All compilations have data files; only some will contain the other kinds.
		* data: Input picks used to constrain the rotation.
		* model: Solution using the listed data constraints
		* command: Input arguments to the hellinger[1|3] programs
		* residual: Misfits between input data and model predictions
		* lowerbound: Lower bound angles needed to contour the lower hemisphere
			confidence limits on the rotation angle
		* upperbound: Upper bound angles needed to contour the upper hemisphere
			confidence boundary on the rotation angle
		* confregion: Polygon perimeter (lat,lon) for the confidence region
			on the rotation pole
<ref>:		Short reference tag to the original publication.
<ext>:		File extension.  This is "pick" for <kind> = "data" and "txt" for others.
NOTES:

1. For most publications, only the data pick files are given.  The model, residual, lowerbound
   upperbound, and confregion can be produced by running hellinger (1 or 3).  Command files
   can usually be made by looking at the publication and they contain default answers to the
   questions posed by the hellinger programs.  For reference, a command file may look like the
   lines below (the # comment lines are just for information and not part of the file):

NAM-AFR.C5.final.data.Muller++_1999_SedBasinWorld.pick		# Input data to be modeled
77.42   31.57   2.56						# Initial guess of lat lon omega 
10								# Search radius in degrees
n								# Want grid search? y/n
0.95								# Enter confidence level
y								# Want an estimated kappa? y/n
y								# Want to write three output files?
NAM-AFR.C5.final.confregion.Muller++_1999_SedBasinWorld.txt	# Name of confidence region boundary file
NAM-AFR.C5.final.upperbound.Muller++_1999_SedBasinWorld.txt	# Name of upper bounds on opening angle
NAM-AFR.C5.final.lowerbound.Muller++_1999_SedBasinWorld.txt	# Name of lower bounds on opening angle

2. The file extension ".txt" was chosen to avoid undesirable behaviors under operating systems
   where file extensions can dictate which programs may open the file, etc.  However, for data
   picks we have changed this to ".pick" so that such files can be read by GPlates.
