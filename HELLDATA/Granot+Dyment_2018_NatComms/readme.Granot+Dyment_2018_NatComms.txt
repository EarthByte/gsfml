README file for the Granot+Dyment_2018_NatComms directory.

These files contain data constraining:

1. The published relative plate motion model for Macquarie (MCQ) and East Antarctica (ANT) for the listed chrons. The data are suitable as input to the modelling program hellinger1.f

2. The published relative plate motion model for Australia (AUS), East Antarctica (ANT) and West Antarctica (MBL) for the listed chrons. The data are suitable as input to the modelling program hellinger3.f

Comment from author:
Attached the hellinger files (mcq-ant is for hellinger1 and the other is for hellinger3. The format is made for a version that Royer is using - i.e., no need for the first line that tells how many segments are being used).
