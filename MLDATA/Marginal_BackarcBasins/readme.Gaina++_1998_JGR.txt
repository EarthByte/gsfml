Magnetic anomaly identifications- Tasman Sea (Gaina et al., 1998)

Synthetic magnetic anomaly profiles were computed using an in-house routine with the following input model parameters: top of magnetic source layer is 3.0 km, and its thickness of 1.5 km, orientation of magnetised bodies is 150 degrees from North. Present inclination and declination of the magnetic field were calculated from IGRF90 model, and the paleoinclination and declination were calculated based on the position of the paleomagnetic pole for the Australian plate at 52 Ma (Irving and Irving, 1982) which resulted in a 28 degrees skewness. We assumed that the Australian plate position has not been drastically changed between 84 and 52 million years, and hence the same skewness value was used for modelling the entire seafloor spreading in the Tasman Sea.
