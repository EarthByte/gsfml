	After prodding by Rex Pilger who tracked down the data, I added the picks
	from Doug Wilder's 2003 thesis with Dave Naar for Pacific-Nazca.
2016-11-09	pwessel
	Added 9 Marginal basin picks processed by Nicky Wright.  The entries are
	Barker (1972), Barker et al. (1995), Patriat et al. (2015), Seton et al. (2016),
	Weissel et al. (1982), Doo et al., (2014), Sasaki et al. (2014), Mrozowski et al. (1972)

	Split Granot et al. (2013) into separate Indian and Pacific Ocean files, w/ readmes.
	Applied minor corrections to Gaina et al (1999), Briais et al (1993),
	Tikku and Cande (1999) [added readme file], Whittaker et al (2007),
	Jacob et al (2014) and Cande and Patriat (2015) data sets.

	Leinweber and Jokat. (Tectonophysics, 2012).
2015-03-23	pwessel
	Added a digitized compilation for the Kula plate (Lonsdale, 1988), fixed
	mislabeled chrons in Wobbe et al. (2012), and renamed the

	to Atwater et al. (1989).
2014-11-5	pwessel
	Added 2 new datasets for the Indian Ocean from Maria Seton:
	Chaubey++_2002_GeoSocLonSP and Fournier++_2010_JGR
2014-10-22	pwessel
	Used newformat.sh to rewrite all *.gmt files with a new DOI aspatial field.
2014-10-11	pwessel
	Added 1 new datasets for the Indian Ocean from Maria Seton:
	Jacob++_2014_JGR
2014-10-09	pwessel

2014-10-09	pwessel
	Revised three files from Nicky Wright: Atwater_1989_GeolSocAm.gmt,
	Klitgord+Mammerickx_1982_JGR.gmt, and Handschumacher_1976_AGUGeopMonoSer.gmt.
	The latter was also renamed from Handschumacher++_1976_AGUGeopMonoSer.gmt
	which was the wrong name.
2014-03-26	pwessel
	Update several files from Nicky Wright to ensure all chrons are
	properly given (i.e., ends in n or r).  Modified hybrid Geek2007 timescale
	for use with Nakanishi++ lineations by extending it with Tominaga et al.
	Replace anomaly end key "m" with "c".  Changed Atwater from 1990 to 1989,
	Eagles++2004_EPSL to Eagles_2003_EPSL, and Gibbons++_2012_G3 to Gibbons++_2013_JGR.
	Add check on central Chron age, introducing 4 decimals for these to avoid needless
	rounding.  Ensure use of "Magnetic Anomaly" throughout.
2014-02-10	pwessel
	Updated the Nakanishi et al, 1992 file from Nicky Wright to fix typos.
	Added format checking to ensure that all Chron strings start with C|M
	and that all aspatial values conform to the requirements. To improve
	clarity we have renamed the field AnomalyEndQua to AnomalyEndQuality

	the EarthByte group.
