This file contains 6858 identifications of Chrons 1n through 6n(old) from the
Carlsberg Ridge from Merkouriev and DeMets (2006). The magnetic data used
for these reversal identifications consist principally of 236,000 km of
Russian shipboard data, but are complimented by aeromagnetic and other shipboard
data archived at the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center. Readers are
referred to Merkouriev and DeMets (2006) for details.

Due to large changes in the skewness of the magnetic profiles within the study
area, all the magnetic profiles were reduced to the pole using the local ridge
azimuth and remanent and ambient field parameters that were calculated for the
location where each profile crosses the ridge (or approaches it most closely).

Reversal identifications were made on a screen that displayed the phase-shifted
digital files and permitted interactive picking from those data. The phase-shifted
profiles were compared to a synthetic magnetic profile calculated at 90N with a
0.5-km-thick magnetic source layer. For shipboard profiles, the top of the magnetic
layer was modeled to be 2.5 km below the surface.
For aeromagnetic profiles, the top of the magnetic layer was modeled to be
2.8 km below the surface since all of the aeroprofiles were flown at
a height of 1000 feet (roughly 300 m) above the ocean surface.
