There are no magnetic anomaly picks plotted as part of this paper.  We digitised this compilation by plotting ship tracks from the EarthByte database (largely NGDC) and digitising the intersection of the ship track and the magnetic lineation drawn on the figure.  This was done only for those ship tracks that had a corresponding magnetic wiggle plotted on image.  

For the North Somali Basin, there was an inconsistency between the age and chron end given in the paper.  Based on our observation of the markings on the synthetic profile, we assumed that M21n(y) was picked.

The chrons for the Amirante and Owen Basins were not completely annotated so we assumed what they were based on the markings on the synthetic profiles provided in the paper.
