The magnetic data that were used for the magnetic reversal identifications
in DeMets and Traylen (2000) consist of shipboard data from the U.S. National
Geophysical Data Center and from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography archives.
Data were used in their original form. Anomaly identifications were made on
a screen that displayed the original digital files and permitted interactive
reversal identifications with those files.

The synthetic magnetic profile for the Pacific-Rivera Rise analysis
used the following parameters:
Remanence directions:
Ir=36.8
Dr=0.0
Ambient field:
Ia=46.0
Da=9.6
Azimuth of ridge: 20.0 CW of north
Depth to top of magnetic source layer: 2.5 km
Depth to bottom of source layer: 3.0 km

The synthetic magnetic profile for the northern Mathematician Rivera Rise analysis
used the following parameters:
Remanence directions:
Ir=36.1
Dr=0.0
Ambient field:
Ia=45.1
Da=9.7
Azimuth of ridge: 0.0 CW of N
Depth to top of magnetic source layer: 2.5 km
Depth to bottom of source layer: 3.0 km
