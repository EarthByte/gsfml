Comment from Rex Pilger, Nov. 3, 2017:

Douglas Wilder completed a Masters thesis in 2003 on East Pacific evolution since 30 Ma
at the University of South Florida, under Dave Naar's direction. I contacted Doug to see
if his magnetic isochron and fracture zone identifications were available. After searching
through some old hard drives, Doug located the data and sent it to me in ESRI format. I
extracted the pertinent data, producing two complementary files for the two data types.
Doug gave me permission to send the data to the GSFML and lineation data bases as well as
use in my own research. The two files are attached.

Doug can be contacted through ResearchGate; his Masters thesis is online:
Wilder, Douglas T., 2003, Relative motion history of the Pacific-Nazca (Farallon) plates
since 30 million years ago, Masters Thesis, University of South Florida, Theses and
Dissertations, Paper 1506, http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/1506. 

Nicky Wright, EarthByte then reformatted the data for arcGIS and Paul Wessel converted
to our OGR_GMT storage and added to the database.  Per Nicky, "a couple of chrons in the
csv file you sent that were not in the thesis, so for consistency sake I have removed them."
