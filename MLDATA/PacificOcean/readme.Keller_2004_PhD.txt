Cruise name abbreviations: ew = Ewing; rs or rigsis = Rig Seismic; NBP or np = Nathaniel B. Palmer; elt or EL or ELT = Eltanin; th = R/V Hakurei Maru, Tanahashi, M., T. Ishihara, M. Yuasa, et al., Preliminary report of the TH95 geological and geophysical survey results in the Ross Sea and Dumont DíUrville Sea, Proc. NIPR Symp. Antarct. Geosci., 10 , 36ñ58, 1997.
PU = R/V Lavrentyev, GEODYNZ or gnz = GEODYNZ cruises


Picking of anomalies was made on screen using a digitizing program that showed profiles of magnetics, gravity and bathymetry vs distance along the track.  This program allowed digitization of the best fit pick and two limits of this pick, to constrain a confidence interval for the location of the pick.

This confidence interval value was then combined with a ship track navigation uncertainty value, to yield the root sum squares, which is the total uncertainty assigned to the pick.

Parameters for the forward magnetic modeling of the Pac-Aus spreading in the Macquarie sector:
Ambient field:
Ia=-76.0
Da=30.0
Magnetic source layer thickness 0.5 km. Magnetization=5 A/m
Skewness assumed to be zero.
Time scale used for model:  Cande & Kent, 1995

Where multibeam swath bathymetry was available, the magnetic anomaly picks from the center of the swaths were extrapolated to the edges of the swaths, following the abyssal hill fabric, and two additional picks were chosen.  Picks chosen in this fashion have "mb" after the ship name.
