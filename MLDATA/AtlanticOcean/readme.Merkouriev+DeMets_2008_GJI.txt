All reversal identifications in this file were made from original digital
shipboard and aeromagnetic data from a variety of sources, including Russian
cruises, the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center, the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory, and France. Roughly 75 percent of the picks in the file originated
with the Merkouriev and DeMets (2009) study. Several thousand additional
reversal identifications have been added as part of a pending follow-up study
that extends the analysis into the Arctic Basin (Merkouriev and DeMets, ms.
in prep. 2014).

All data were used in their original form. Anomaly identifications were made on
a screen that displayed the original digital files and permitted interactive
reversal identifications with those files.

The data span 8000 km of the Arctic and north Atlantic basins and were thus
modeled with location-dependent synthetic magnetic profiles, as follows:
