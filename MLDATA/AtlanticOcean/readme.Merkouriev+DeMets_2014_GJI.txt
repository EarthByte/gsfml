All reversal identifications in this file were made from original digital
shipboard and aeromagnetic data from a variety of sources, including Russian
cruises, the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center, France, and the Netherlands.
Readers are referred to DeMets and Merkouriev (2014) for further information.

All data were used in their original form. Anomaly identifications were made on
a screen that displayed the original digital files and permitted interactive
reversal identifications with those files.

The data were modeled with location-dependent synthetic magnetic profiles,
as follows:

Profiles from 15N to 19N

Remanence directions:
Ir=29.8
Dr=0.0
Ambient field:
Ia=34.0
Da=-18.6
Azimuth of ridge: 3.0 CW of north
Depth to top of magnetic source layer: 2.5 km
Depth to bottom of source layer: 3.0 km

Profiles from 20N to 29N

Remanence directions:
Ir=36.1
Dr=0.0
Ambient field:
Ia=32.0
Da=-17.1
Azimuth of ridge: 7.0 CW of N
Depth to top of magnetic source layer: 2.5 km
Depth to bottom of source layer: 3.0 km

Profiles from 30N to 37N

Remanence directions:
Ir=55.5
Dr=0.0
Ambient field:
Ia=53.6
Da=-16.0
Azimuth of ridge: 17.0 CW of N
Depth to top of magnetic source layer: 2.5 km
Depth to bottom of source layer: 3.0 km
