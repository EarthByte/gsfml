The magnetic data that were used included shipboard data in their original form from the NGDC data base.

Picking of anomalies was made on screen using a digitizing program that showed profiles of magnetics, gravity and bathymetry vs distance along the track.  This program allowed digitization of the best fit pick and two limits of this pick, to constrain a confidence interval for the location of the pick.

This confidence interval value was then combined with a ship track navigation uncertainty value, to yield the root sum squares, which is the total uncertainty assigned to the pick.

Anomalied identified:  27o, 28y, 28/29 (C28r-middle), 29o, 30y, 30/31 (C30r-middle), 31m, 32a, 32o, 33y, 33o, 34y

Parameters for the forward magnetic modeling of the Anomalies in the Agulhas Basin :
Model skewness is 20 degrees, based on the modern inclination/declination values of -65 degrees, 25 degrees, and paleofield inclination/declination values of -74, 0.  The paleofield values correspond to an average paleolatitude of -59 degrees for the study area, which is based on the assumptions that 1) ANT remained fixed relative to the south magnetic pole, and 2) AF (including the eastern half of the study area) moved away from ANT according to the rotation parameters given in the publication.

Time scale used for model:  Cande & Kent, 1995
