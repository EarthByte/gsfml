Synthetic magnetic anomaly profiles computed using magbath (Naar/Morgan/Wilson/Livermore/Eagles) with 1 km thick source source layer whose top surface is at bathymetry. Original longitudes and latitudes (for remanent inclination and declination) calculated for South American and Antarctic plates. 

Magnetic anomaly identifications from NGDC-archived profiles and legacy data held at British Antarctic Survey. Some picks carried over from Nankivell (1996) and Livermore et al. (2005).

Edit by Nicky Wright:
The following identifications are not included:
- 21P, 25P, and 28P, where ‘P’ stands for the peak in the magnetic anomaly
- I2 and I, which are based on magnetic intensity highs that occur over seafloor that formed during the Cretaceous normal polarity magnetic superchron.
- MAU, which are picks at the rifted edge of Maud Rise.
- WSE, which are picks at the edge of Weddell Sea continental shelf
- ORI, which are picks at the northern edge of the Orion-Andenes magnetic anomaly
