Magnetic anomaly identifications- North Atlantic and Eurasia Basin (Gaina et al., 2002)

Synthetic magnetic anomaly profiles were computed using in-house routines (University of Sydney and Geological Survey of Canada) for several
spreading corridors along various sub-basins in the North Atlantic and Arctic region. Present inclination and declination of the magnetic field were calculated from IGRF98 model, and the paleoinclination and declination were calculated using Van der Voo (1993) paleomagnetic poles for the opening of the North Atlantic.
