Picks used for 
Eagles, G. and Scott, B.G.C., 2014, Plate convergence west of Patagonia and the Antarctic Peninsula since 61Ma, Global and Planetary Change, 123, 189-198, 2014.

Synthetic magnetic anomaly profiles computed using magbath (Naar/Morgan/Wilson/Livermore/Eagles) with 1 km thick source source layer whose top surface is at bathymetry. Original longitudes and latitudes (for remanent inclination and declination) calculated for Antarctic plate. 

Magnetic anomaly identifications from NGDC-archived profiles and legacy data held at British Antarctic Survey.
