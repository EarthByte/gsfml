Picks used for 
Pérez-Díaz, L. and Eagles, G., 2014, Constraining South Atlantic growth with seafloor spreading data, Tectonics, 33, 1848-1873.

Synthetic magnetic anomaly profiles computed using magbath (Naar/Morgan/Wilson/Livermore/Eagles) with 1 km thick source source layer whose top surface is at bathymetry. Original longitudes and latitudes (for remanent inclination and declination) calculated for South American and African plates. 

Magnetic anomaly identifications from NGDC-archived profiles and legacy data held at British Antarctic Survey. Some picks carried over from Nankivell (1996) and Eagles (2007).
