#	Information file for Magnetic Pick data formats
#
#	Paul Wessel, Oct. 2014

This directory contains the published magnetic picks used in the study plate tectonics.
Typically, a subset of these picks have been selected and used in plate motion modeling;
if available these subset have been reformatted into data suitable for the Chang et al
modeling software; see the HELL subpage for further details.

The magnetic pick data are distributed in three file formats:
1) ESRI Shapefiles.  These can be ingested by most GIS tools
2) GMT/OGR ASCII tables.  These can be used by GMT and other tools
3) KML files.  These can be read by Google Earth and similar tools.

All formats contain the same information.  The name of the file derives from the
publication and uses the format <author(s)_<year>_<journal>.<extension>, where
extensions are .shp (actually several sub-files as well), *.gmt, and *.kml.
Because ESRI shapefiles actually consists of several separate files per dataset
we distribute these in zip archives instead, hence files are called *.zip.

The data files contain these observations:

lon, lat:	The location of the magnetic pick.

The data files also contain these metadata:
# @NChron|AnomalyEnd|AnomEndQua|CruiseName|Reference|DOI|GeeK2007|IDMethod

E.g.,

# @DC13n|y|1|N/A|Cande++_1988_JGR|10.1029/JB093iB11p13479|33.058|"Magnetic Anomaly"

Chron:		The chron name [e.g., C13n]
AnomalyEnd:	End of anomaly being picked, i.e., young (y), old (o)
		or center (c).
AnomEndQua:	Confidence in the anomaly end assignment.  Ranges from
		1 = anomaly end clearly listed in the original paper;
		2 = some problem exist from original paper but there is
		    confidence in the anomaly end assignment
		3 = anomaly end unclear in the original paper and the end
		    has been inferred by the data assembler.
CruiseName:	Cruise name designation (NGDC) if known, otherwise N/A.
Reference:	The publication reference [e.g., Cande et al. (1988)]
DOI:		The DOI of the publication, if known, otherwise N/A.
GeeK2007:	The assigned age based on the Gee and Kent [2007] time scale.
		Note: Other time scales can be used via the Chron name.
IDMethod:	Typically "Magnetic Anomaly" but could be other identifiers
		such as "Abyssal Hill".
